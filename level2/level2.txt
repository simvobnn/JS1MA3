1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
    JavaScript code style is how the source code is written in the text editor, determining the readability for the program interpreter and other human beings. All code must correspond to the program interpreters’ requirements, but outside of these requirements there is still different ways to write code and this is where differences between different coders will emerge in different code styles.
